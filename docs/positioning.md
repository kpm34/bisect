### Quadrant Analysis

| Position | Tools | Characteristics | Why Users Leave |
|----------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Complex + Single | Blender | Pro 3D, steep learning curve | Too complex for quick content |
| Complex + Multi | ComfyUI | Powerful but node-based | Intimidating UI, no collaboration |
| Simple + Single | Runway, CapCut | Easy video, one purpose | Can't do 3D, no pipeline |
| Simple + Multi | Canva | Accessible, templates | No real 3D, no Blender quality |

### Bisect's Sweet Spot

**Upper-right quadrant** but accessible:
- **Complex enough**: Blender bridge for pro-quality output
- **Multi-purpose**: Vector → 3D → Video pipeline
- **Approachable**: Visual UI, not node-based
- **Web-first**: React exports, embeddable components

---

## What Bisect IS

| Identity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| ✓ Creative pipeline hub | End-to-end content creation, not a single tool |
| ✓ Blender complexity abstraction | Pro 3D quality without the learning curve |
| ✓ AI video aggregator & editor | Connect to Runway, Pika, Kling - orchestrate them |
| ✓ Web-first output | React components, landing pages, WebGL embeds |
| ✓ Brand-to-social content factory | Logo → 3D → Video → Social in one flow |

---

## What Bisect is NOT

| Anti-Identity | Why Not |
|---------------|---------|
| ✗ A Blender replacement for 3D pros | We're the bridge, not the competitor |
| ✗ A Figma competitor for UI/UX | We're 3D-first, not 2D design |
| ✗ A code-heavy developer tool | Visual-first, code export is output |
| ✗ A single-purpose AI video generator | We're the orchestrator across tools |
| ✗ An enterprise DAM system | We're creative workflow, not asset management |

---

## Competitive Differentiation

### vs. Blender
| Blender | Bisect |
|---------|--------|
| Steep learning curve | Visual, approachable UI |
| Desktop only | Web-first |
| Manual workflows | AI-assisted |
| Single tool | Multi-studio pipeline |
| **We use Blender** | As our rendering engine via MCP bridge |

### vs. Spline / Vectary
| Spline/Vectary | Bisect |
|----------------|--------|
| Closed ecosystem | Blender bridge (pro quality) |
| No AI agents | Natural language editing |
| No video pipeline | Vector → 3D → Video |
| Limited exports | React, Three.js, GLB, Video |
| No e-commerce | Shopify/WooCommerce integration |

### vs. ComfyUI
| ComfyUI | Bisect |
|---------|--------|
| Node-based (complex) | Visual UI (approachable) |
| Local only | Web-based, collaborative |
| Image/video focus | Full 3D pipeline |
| Technical users | Creative professionals |
| **We integrate** | ComfyUI as a backend |

### vs. Runway / Pika
| Runway/Pika | Bisect |
|-------------|--------|
| Video generation only | Full creative pipeline |
| No 3D capabilities | Blender-powered 3D |
| Single output | Multi-format exports |
| No scene editing | Interactive 3D scenes |
| **We aggregate** | Their video APIs |

### vs. Canva
| Canva | Bisect |
|-------|--------|
| Template-based | From-scratch creation |
| 2D focused | 3D-first |
| No Blender quality | Pro rendering |
| Consumer | Prosumer/Professional |
| No code export | Developer-friendly |

## Target User Personas

### Primary: The Creative Generalist
- **Role**: Solo creator, small agency, startup founder
- **Need**: Create professional 3D content without learning Blender
- **Pain**: Fragmented tools, expensive specialists, slow pipelines
- **Job**: "I need a 3D product showcase for my landing page by Friday"

### Secondary: The Technical Creative
- **Role**: Developer who needs creative output
- **Need**: Code-exportable 3D scenes and components
- **Pain**: Design tools don't speak code, 3D is a black box
- **Job**: "I need a React component with an interactive 3D model"

### Tertiary: The Brand Team
- **Role**: Marketing, brand managers
- **Need**: Consistent 3D brand assets across channels
- **Pain**: Can't iterate quickly, dependent on 3D specialists
- **Job**: "We need 3D versions of our logo for social, web, and video"

## Key Messages

### Elevator Pitch (10 seconds)
> "Bisect is the Cursor of creative work - an AI-powered platform that connects 3D, design, and video workflows so you can go from logo to landing page to video in one place."

### Value Proposition (30 seconds)
> "Today's creative pipeline is fragmented. You design in one tool, model in another, render somewhere else, and export to yet another. Bisect connects these workflows with AI agents and a live Blender bridge, so you get professional 3D quality with an approachable interface. Create your logo, apply it to a 3D product, generate materials, build an immersive landing page, and export as React components - all without leaving the browser."

### Differentiator (15 seconds)
> "Unlike Spline or Vectary, we have a live Blender bridge for pro-quality rendering. Unlike ComfyUI, we have an approachable visual interface. Unlike Runway, we do the full 3D pipeline. We're the connective tissue across creative domains."

## Strategic Priorities

### Protect & Strengthen (Moats)
1. **Blender MCP Bridge** - No competitor has this
2. **Cross-domain pipeline** - Vector → 3D → Video
3. **AI agent system** - Natural language workflows
4. **Developer exports** - React, Three.js, code

### Build (Gaps to Fill)
1. **Video Studio** - Complete the pipeline
2. **Audio Hub** - Music/SFX library + AI generation (can't ship videos without audio)
3. **ComfyUI integration** - Leverage node workflows without complexity
4. **CLI tools** - Developer experience like Cursor
5. **Hyper3D/Meshy** - AI 3D generation in pipeline

### Avoid (Not Our Game)
1. Feature parity with Blender (we bridge, not replace)
2. Enterprise DAM features
3. Figma-style 2D design tools
4. Code-first interfaces

---

## Success Metrics

### North Star
**Complete creative workflows per user** - How many users go Vector → 3D → Export?

### Supporting Metrics
| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| Cross-studio usage | Are users using multiple studios? |
| Blender bridge calls | Is our moat being used? |
| Export diversity | React, GLB, Video - full pipeline? |
| AI agent interactions | Natural language adoption |
| Time to first export | Onboarding effectiveness |
