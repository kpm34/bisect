# Unified 3D Creator - Project Memory

## Project Overview
Unified platform merging Prism (3D scene editor) and VectorCraft AI (vector/texture tools) into one application. Using VectorCraft as the shell, bringing Prism as an additional canvas for a fully integrated app.

**Goal**: Create a Spline-like tool with zero learning curve for:
- UI development
- 3D workflows
- Branding/logo creation
- Website UI enhancement
- AR/VR flows

## Current Status (60% Complete)

### ✅ Completed
- Foundation: Next.js 14, Shell component, three studios with routing
- Vector Studio: Complete SVG editor with 15+ tools, AI vectorization, 7 export formats
- Texture Studio: MatCap/PBR generation with Gemini AI, auto normal/roughness maps
- 3D Studio Core: Universal format support, material library (600+ presets), transform controls, scene hierarchy

### ⚠️ Partially Complete
- AI Orchestrator: Routing logic done, but API implementations are placeholders
- Drag & Drop: Structure complete, drop handlers have TODOs
- Cross-Studio Integration: State management exists but not fully connected

### ❌ Missing Critical Features
- **Object Creation**: No primitive creation tools (cubes, spheres, etc.)
- **Boolean Operations**: Union, Subtract, Intersect not implemented
- **Animation System**: Timeline placeholder only, no keyframe system
- **Scene Settings**: Lighting, camera, environment controls missing
- **AR/VR**: Not started
- **Material Editor**: No custom material creation UI
- **Export Hub**: No unified export interface

## Key Files

### Core Integration
- `lib/ai/orchestrator.ts` - Multi-agent AI routing (needs API implementations)
- `lib/store/unified-store.ts` - Zustand state management
- `lib/drag-drop/bridge.ts` - Cross-studio asset transfer (has TODOs)
- `components/shared/Shell.tsx` - Main navigation shell

### Studios
- `app/studio/vector/` - Vector Studio (95% complete)
- `app/studio/textures/` - Texture Studio (90% complete)
- `app/studio/scene/` - 3D Studio (70% core, 20% advanced)

### Documentation
- `PROJECT_MAP.md` - Cross-project navigation guide
- `INTEGRATION_STATUS.md` - Detailed status and TODO list
- `README.md` - Project overview and architecture

## Priority Tasks

### Phase 1 (Critical)
1. Connect AI Orchestrator to actual APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude)
2. Complete drag & drop handlers (implement TODOs)
3. Add object creation tools (primitives)
4. Implement boolean operations

### Phase 2 (High Priority)
5. Build animation timeline and keyframe system
6. Implement scene settings panel (lighting, camera, environment)

### Phase 3 (Medium Priority)
7. Create material editor UI
8. Add AR/VR support (WebXR)
9. Build unified export hub

## Recent Updates
- Added comprehensive AI agent system (Claude Planner, Gemini Spatial, Material Agent)
- Enhanced material system with presets and preview generation
- Added Material Drawer and Preview Panel components
- Integrated specialized agents for scene graph building and visual analysis

## Architecture Notes
- Uses Next.js 14 App Router
- Three isolated studios connected via drag-drop bridge
- Multi-agent AI system (GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude)
- Zustand for state, IndexedDB for persistence
- React Three Fiber for 3D rendering
- Universal format adapters (Spline, GLTF, GLB, FBX, OBJ)
